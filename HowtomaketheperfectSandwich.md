## 5 steps to make a sandwich and start creating your own masterpieces.

- ### Use Quality Ingredients

You must start with delicious, high-quality ingredients to make your own tasty sandwich. The next time you take a trip to the grocery store or the farmers market, you’ll want to pick up an array of fresh ingredients to build the ideal sandwich:

> - Get sliced fresh deli meat for a quick bite, or pick an option you can marinate for a delectable layer.
> - Skip the presliced, packaged cheeses for artisan alternatives in the cheese area. The extra preparation will be worth the flavor of an aged cheddar from a local farm.
> - Be sure to grab whole vegetables like tomatoes and romaine lettuce to slice up for your sandwich.

- ### Incorporate Sauces and Spreads

Once you have your quality ingredients, it’s time to consider the sauces and spreads. The right condiments can transform a good sandwich into a great one.

Some classic sandwich condiments include:

- Chipotle mayonnaise
- Dijon mustard
- Hummus
- Tzatziki
- Fruit jam
- Pepper jelly
- Barbecue sauce
- Pesto

- ### Use Seasonings

Remember healthy herbs and spices when planning how to make sandwiches. These can add depth and complexity to your creation.

Fresh herbs like **basil**, **cilantro** or **dill** can add brightness and elevate your sandwich. Mix dried herbs and spices into spreads or sprinkle them directly onto your other ingredients. Consider options like **_oregano_** for Italian-style sandwiches or a dash of **_smoked paprika_** for a hint of smokiness.

- ### Avoid Overstuffing

When making a sandwich, it's important to avoid overstuffing, as this can make it difficult to eat and messy.

The **key** to a great sandwich is balance and harmony of flavors. Start with moderate amounts of each ingredient so that no one element overpowers the others. This approach ensures that you can enjoy the distinct tastes and textures of all the components while keeping the sandwich easy to handle.

- ### Grill the Final Product

> Toasting your sandwich can add extra flavor and texture. Before you add your cold ingredients, add butter to a hot pan or spread mayonnaise on the outside of the bread and toast either side of your sandwich until golden brown. Try brushing the bread with olive oil and sprinkling with grated Parmesan before grilling for an extra crispy exterior. Ensure you include your cold ingredients afterward to complete the perfect sandwich!
